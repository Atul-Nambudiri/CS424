I created a new program. The source is in new_test.cc, and the output program in new_test. Running make will generate this.

TODO - Fix/Integrate Cliff Drop Sensor, Fix Plotting, Test everything, create three plots, and then create the report

Changes Made - Change movement pattern so that the robot moves in arcs - This fixes many issues, but plotting may be harder. 

These following two functions occur in the correction loop:

When the the robot senses it is close to the wall, it stops, turns counterclockwise a specific extra_angle, and then keeps moving in an arc

If instead the rightBump sensor is triggered, the robot stops, moves back, turns counterclockwise the specific extra_angle * a multiplier, and then keeps moving in an arc. This is so that there is less of a chance of the robot hitting the wall again after the first bump

In both of these cases, everytime the robot turns the extra angle, the extra angle is reduced by 5 degrees, with a minimum of 5 degrees. This is so that if these commands are triggered multiple times in a row, the effect is lessened each time.
Everytime you go through the correction loop without triggering these function, the angle is incremented by 3,  back up to the original value for extra_angle

If both the left and right bump sensors are triggered at the same time, the robot does a left turn. Note that this does not occur only when there is a left turn in the maze. Based on how the robot arcs, the robot could hit the middle of the wall head on, triggering a left turn. 
This turn in the same as before, but it also turns the extra angle, so that the robot sticks out past parallel, so that it has some room to arc.
